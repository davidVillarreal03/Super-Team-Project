-Description 

An app that allows the user to see top comments about San Antonio from the Reddit API and then search the search API 

-Motivation: 

Majority of the team was from San Antonio Fun and different ways to pick a local spot rather than just reading about specific places, this gives the user an opportunity to choose what to read about 

-This project is to show the attractions in San Antonio while utilizing the API's that the team found to be the most useful for this application. 

- This allows user to find local attractions and restaurants near them that they might not be able to locate all in one page otherwise. 

-What did you learn? We learned how to best utilize API's and which different API sources work best for certain projects.
