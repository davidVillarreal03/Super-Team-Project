# Description | Super Team Project

An app that allows the user to see comments from locals about San Antonio from the Reddit API and then search for places of interest utilizing the SerpApi search engine

## Motivation

The majority of the team is from San Antonio so we wanted to create something close to us. We wanted to create a website that would attract tourists and give them some honest and deep information that locals are commenting about. We decided to utilize the Reddit Api because Reddit is often straightforward, no holds barred.

- The website offers fun and different ways to pick a local spot rather than just reading about specific places, this gives the user an opportunity to choose what to read about.

## Features

Search bar to locate local destinations, links connecting to Reddit API sources that access storage of comments of people who have been to the locations and their reviews. Links connecting user to new and popular attractions, and allowing the user to view Reddit comments on these destinations as well.
