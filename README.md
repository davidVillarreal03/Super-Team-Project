## Description
An app that allows the user to see top comments about San Antonio from the Reddit API and then seach the search API
-Motivation:
Majority of the team was from San Antonio
Fun and different ways to pick a local spot rather than just reading about specific places, this gives the user an oppotunity to choose what to read about
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    This project is to show the attractions in San Antonio while utalizing the API's that the team found to be the most useful for this application. 
- What problem does it solve?
    This allows user to find local attractions and restaurants near them that they might not be able to locate all in one page other wise.
- What did you learn?
    We learned how to best utalize API's and which different API sources work best for certain projects.
